Wealcome indeed! Or welcome back?

If you already know us, you can clearly see that we didn't like our [old blog][old-blog], so, we chose to start from scratch!

If instead you don't already know us, welcome!(*also what? you don't know us? Sad*)<br>
We're Weatherlight, a gamedev team, *and now webdev too*, of currently 4 people.

Since the last blogpost on our [old blog][old-blog] we improved and learned a lot, but it was increasingly becoming harder to find useful resources for what we wanted, so here we are. <br>
We decided to build a "database" for the team to store useful resources, and since it's a single database we can spread them to each other easily. Since we were also looking for a personal blog, and with the knowledge to create websites, we decided to start again from scratch, so here we are!

### What to expect:

Definitely expect the [Useful Resources](/resources/) section to change in the next days, maybe it will keep increasing forever.

Do also expect the website to change, or at least to have some *slight* editing.

### What **NOT** to expect:

Do **NOT** expect regular uploads. This is not a full fledged Blog, it's just our safe space where we can do and say what we want.

Do **NOT** expect us to talk of something before the time comes. Most of the stuff we'll talk about is stuff which already came out, and most likely we're not gonna talk about currently in-dev features.<br>
But **DO** expect us to talk about cool stuff we find or do, that's the exciting part.

Do **NOT** expect this to be our main website, this is just our Blog. We have another website for the Team which is currently under developement, so stay tuned for that!

We'll see you in the *future* where this website is a little more complete. For now, you can hang around and contact us. You can definitely find us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Weatherlight_WS) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/weatherlightteam/) and you can even contact us on Discord (for example Cogno_Marco#8175) or via email (weatherlightstudios@gmail.com)

See you in the next blog post!<br>
Hope to see you around.
