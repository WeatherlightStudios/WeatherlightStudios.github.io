This blog has *mainly* 2 purposes:

1. Being a news feed to stay updated either on what we did, what we're doing, or what we're gonna *eventually* do
2. This is an archive of resources that you *might or might not* find useful. This is mainly a database for the team, but you can help us build a bigger database yourself. You can find how [here](/how-to-contribute/)
