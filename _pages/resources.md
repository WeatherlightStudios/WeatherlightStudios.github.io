##   A Collection of Useful Resources

> Hope u enjoy learning

This section is a collective collection of useful resources for people to find, divided by meaningful sections and each with a quick proper explanation.<br>
Collective meaning you can help increase this collection with your own links: to know how, you can take a look at [this section here](/how-to-contribute/).<br>
The resources you can find span a moltitude of arguments, but are mostly focused on Game Developement (you might find something else though, like webdev and general programming).

With each resource there will be a quick little explanation, just to know what that resource is about.

Every resource has also been categorized with a tag, saying the median level of knowledge required and/or the difficulty understanding/implementing/using said resource.<br>
These are very subjective thoughts so don't be scared to check them anyway.









##   C++

> Because there are never enough c++ resources
